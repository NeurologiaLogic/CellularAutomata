# CellularAutomata
```
How many generations -> how many iterations will the maze iterate
Rule set:
  B -> how will the cell be born ex: 34 means the cell will be born when there are 3 or 4 neighbors
  S -> how will the cell survive ex: 12345 means that the cell will survive to the next generation when there are precisely 1/2/3/4/5 neighbors out of the 8 neighbours
